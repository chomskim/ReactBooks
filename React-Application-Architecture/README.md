## Requirements

- **Node.js** version 16 or above and **npm** version 8 or above
  [There are a couple of different ways to install node and npm.](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/blog/5-ways-to-install-node-js/)

- **VSCode** (optional) is currently the most popular editor/IDE for JavaScript/TypeScript, so we will be using it. It is open source, has great integration with TypeScript, and we can extend its features via extensions. It can be downloaded from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/.

## Installation

To start using the code files, the first step is to clone the repository locally on your machine.

If you are using the repository for the first time, once it is cloned locally, you need to do the following steps:

##### Install the dependencies:
to install the dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

##### Configure environment
To configure envirionment variables, create the `.env` file by copying the the content from `.env.example`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

## Usage

The setup has been configured to allow you to work on the code of a specific chapter. To do so, you need to select the chapter code you want to work on. The following commands are available:


##### Select a chapter code:
To select a chapter code, you need to run the following command:

```sh
npm run stage:switch
```

This command will prompt you with a list of stages for each chapter: 
```
? What stage do you want to switch to? (Use arrow 
 keys) 
‚ùØ chapter-02 
 chapter-03 
 chapter-03-start 
 chapter-04 
 chapter-04-start 
 chapter-05 
 chapter-05-start 
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```
For example, if you want to follow along with the code of chapter 5, you need to select `chapter-05-start`. If you only want to see the final code of chapter 5, you can select `chapter-05`.

The files of the selected chapter will be copied to the main directory. You can now start working on the code.

##### Start the dev server:
To start the dev server, you need to run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
The dev server will be started on port 3000. You can access the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

##### Save changes of the selected chapter code:
If you want to save the changes you made to the code of the selected chapter in the main directory, you need to run the following command:
```sh
npm run stage:save
```

##### Clear the chapter selection:
If you want to clear the chapter selection, you need to run the following command:

```sh
npm run stage:clear
```
